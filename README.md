# PyBer_Analysis
- Python 3.10
- jupyter notebook
## The purpose of this Analysis
This analysis served multiple purposes, it was done for a popular ride sharing company called PyBer, akin to Uber but much better. The company CEO V. Isualize wanted us to calculate data such as total fares, total rides given, total drivers, average fare per ride, and average fare for the driver. This analysis was conducted on 3 different types of cities: Suburban, Urban and Rural areas. The data analyzed was from the start of 2019 untill the 28th of April 2019. The overall goal was to provide useful metrics for the CEO to determine any differences amongst the city types to optimize performance for the company and the employees, and patrons.
## Results of the analysis
In our analysis we found some very interesting differences in total drivers, rides given and the average fare per driver. The biggest disparity was between Rural and Urban areas.![PyBer_city_type_results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102084269/166354130-1b827c0f-36fe-4c47-b4ab-9863e04f2a00.PNG)
Due to these findings we can observe that the overall number of rides and drivers in Urban areas far exceeds that of rural areas, but the findings show us that the amount of money made by Urban drivers is significantly less than that made from Rural drivers.
We were also tasked with creating a multiple line chart showing the Total Fare by City Type from the same time frame.

This graph shows a powerful visualization of the data showing that the Urban areas had the highest total Fare throughout the entire time period while Rural had the least. One common ground the all shared was peaks and valleys in the data.
## Summary of the PyBer analysis
- Rural cities had the least amount of rides and made the least amount of gross income, but their fare wage per ride far exceeded that of the highest grossing Urban areas. It seems that the high paying wage would be a good marketing point for PyBer to increase its drivers and reach into the Rural landscape
- The suburban cities were the middle preformers of the city types
- The Urban cities have much more traffic, more people, and more drivers. It is used to such a degree that PyBer should look into optimizing their strategy in those areas to increase pay for the employee, while increasing their profit, reach, and not sacrifice anything for the patrons.
